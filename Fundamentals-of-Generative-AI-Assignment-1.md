### Differentiate between AI, machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and applied AI.

#### AI

AI is the supper set of machine learning, deep learning and genrative AI. AI is like umberalla that combines all technoligies.

#### Machine Learning

Machine is the first basic step of AI. it also called shallow learning. It needs small datasets. It can handle tabular data easilly. It needs low compute power for training and inference. Most famous algorithms are linear regression, logistic regression, Randomforest, xgboost etc.

#### Deep Learning

deep learning is the next version of AI. It bases in neural networks which require a lot of compute power and larg amount of data. Accuracy is directly proportional with data. It can learn from images, text, tabular data and time series data. NLP, Computer vision and GANS are subdomains of deep learning. Most famous algorithms are, ANN, CNNS, LSTM, Encoders and GANS. deep learning require heavy compute power like GPUS and high amount of datasets. but it can perform specific task according to trained dataset. we can do transfer learning, finetuning and can train models from scratch.

### Generative AI

Genrative AI is subdomain of deep learning. It is next revolution in the domain of AI. It consist of LLMS and Multi models architures. GenAI is based on transformers. It can perform genaric tasks like it can generate text, images, voices, videos. GPTS, LLAMA, DALL E are foundational model. There are closed source and open source foundational models.
We can use use GUI of these foundation model and also we can use their APIs. For custom tasks we can fintune these LLMs using pytorch. Fintune needs a huge amount of compute power which is not possible for indivisuals.

### Applied AI

There are researchers and companies who have a high budget to build architectures from scratch. It needs a lot of manpower and budgets. We as a developer use their models and architectures for some specific tasks. IN case of deep learning there are base models trained on millions of images and text. We use there base layers and fintune for a specifi task. this is called applied AI.
Now in case of GenAI GPTs, LLAMA, DALL e models are base models trained on a huge amount of data and required a lot of computation power. We use these models api and develope smart apps for use.
